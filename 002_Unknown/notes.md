# 002_Unknown

- opens up about Ethereum
- talks about wallets briefly


## Wallets

- go ahead and install a browser wallet (ideally metamask if you want to follow along best)

- NEVER share your mnemonic 

- as you can see you can make multiple accounts with one deterministic mnemonic

- there are multiple networks

    - the ethereum mainnet is the primary one for transacting live real transactions, but you have testnets like goerli or rinkeby as well
    
- to get test net ether, you need a faucet -- a good one for rinkeby is:
    - [chainlink faucet](faucets.chain.link/rinkeby)
    
- come back here and replace the rest with patricks other tutorial that you already wrote
