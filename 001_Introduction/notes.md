# 001_Introduction

- talks about nick szabo, vitalik, bitcoin, ethereum, etc
- talks about smart contracts (bitcoin is turing incomplete)
- shills chainlink (oracles)
- hybrid smart contracts = off chain and on chain data to defeat the unhelpful aspects of determinism
- Dapp = Smart Contracts that make an application

## Web Versions

- Web1: The permissionless open sourced web with static content.

- Web2: The permissioned web, with dynamic content. Companies run your agreements/code on servers

- Web3: The permissionless web, with dynamic content. Decentralized censorship-resistant networks run your agreements/code; user-owned ecosystems.

## Smart Contracts Pros & Cons

- everything you do is a set of contracts
  - think of a chair:
    1. somebody had to contract to buy the lumbar
    2. somebody had to contract to assemble the chair
    3. you had to make a buy agreement with the seller
    4. etc

  - think insurance:
    1. you pay a car insurance company and have an agreement
    2. agreement states they pay you if you damage a vehicle

- the problem with modern day contracts, is it's more like a pinky swear backed by a legal system that sometimes fails or can take lots of time and money to even deal with
  - McDonalds did this in the 90's with the chance to win millions, where you couldn't actually win -- this was a false promise
    - if this had been on a smart contract, they never could have stolen that money

<br>

- often times companies and/or counterparties actually want the exact opposite of you want when it comes time to fulfill their contract/promise
  - a good example of this might be an insurance company who literally doesn't want to pay you when you actually need to redeem your funds
  - banks that invest your money and literally don't want you to take it out (think what happens during bank runs)
  
  
<br>

- we are going from a brand based society to a math/logic based society
    - i.e. trust my logo -> transparency is unavoidable & counterparty risk is almost null

## Wrap Up (Benefits of Blockchain)

> Main Feature: Trust Minimized Agreements

1. Decentralized
    - node operaters run the network -- these can be anyone who owns the machine
    
2. Transparency & Flexibility
    - nothing shady going on; everyone has the same information (ideally)
    - also psuedo-anonymity; which allows you to hide your identity and be known as an address
    
3. Speed & Efficiency
    - better transaction speeds and no downtime -- send money anytime to anyone (eventually)
    
4. Security & Immutability
    - you cant alter a smart contract, once it's published it's done, you would need to make a new one and convince users to switch
    - you can't steal a password to hack a blockchain (like a centralized db), you would need half of whatever the proof is
    - the blockchain is a ledger that can't be altered -- you can't just change it like a database, you would need everyone to agree
    
5. Counterparty Risk Removal
    - no ability for organizations to deny their side of the contract when it does not suit them; the contract will run it's course no matter what
    - less legal reliance
    
6. Trust Minimized Agreements
    - again, math + logic > brand
    - programmatic unbreakable promises
